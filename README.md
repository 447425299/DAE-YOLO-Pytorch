# DAE-YOLO: Remote Sensing Small Targets Detection Method

A implementation of the DAE-YOLO model proposed in the paper *"DAE-YOLO: Remote Sensing Small Targets Detection Method Integrating YOLO and State Space Models"* (File: remotesensing-3714155.pdf). This model is designed to enhance small target detection performance in remote sensing images by integrating YOLO11 with innovative modules, addressing challenges such as limited target information, weak feature representation, and complex backgrounds .


## üåü Key Innovations
- **Dynamic Spatial Sequence Module (DSSM)**: Replaces traditional C3k2 modules with visual state space models to capture long-range spatial dependencies, expanding the receptive field by 3.2√ó with linear computational complexity, which is crucial for sparsely distributed small targets in high-resolution remote sensing images .
- **Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (AMFE)**: Utilizes separable kernel attention to adaptively enhance small target features while suppressing background interference, maintaining an equivalent 11√ó11 receptive field with reduced computational complexity (from O(k¬≤) to O(k)) .
- **Efficient Dual-level Attention Mechanism (EDAM)**: Reduces computational complexity by 75.5% through hierarchical region-level and pixel-level routing attention, balancing global context modeling and efficiency for large-scale remote sensing images .
